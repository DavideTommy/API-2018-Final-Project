Contributions
No maintenance is scheduled on this project. I will not review any pull request, nor answer to issues.

If you want to contribute to this project fork it. Be carefull that in parser code is used a Linux feature about data input and store in 
scanf using the %ms for an automatic dynamic memory allocation of input stream buffers. I can't assure it will work on Windows systems.

# Warranty
This software is provided AS IS, without any implicit or explicit warranty. Feel free to use it, if you want, but please don't ask me for support.

I can't guarantee that I will answer.

Thanks
